\description{
Recognise date-time variables when month and year are known (otherwise there
is no way to differentiate date and month)
}
\details{
Assumptions made on the format of input time are:
(i) only "/" or "-" is used to separate date, month and year, and no mixture
 of the two symbols in a single time variable;
(ii) only ":" is used to separate hour, minute and second, and the order is
  always in "h:m:s" (second can be missing, but not minute or hour); and
(iii) a dateTime variable should contain both date and time.
